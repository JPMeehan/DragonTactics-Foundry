The intentions of these patrons are inscrutable, even to the warlocks granted power.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Patron #1</strong> Havok'tar is a spirit from Dal Quor that embodies the rage against broader forces beyond an individual's control</p>\n<p><strong>Example Patron #2</strong> The King in Yellow is an ancient Xoriat spirit with a number of active cults</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus At-Will</strong> You gain the <em>Spiteful Glamour</em> power</p>\n<p><strong>Pact Boon</strong> You gain the <em>Hidden Lore</em> power</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Hidden Lore</h4>\n<p><em>As an enemy falls, you gain an uncanny insight to help you with your next task</em></p>\n<p>Level 1 Spell</p>\n<p>Arcane</p>\n<p><strong>Action:</strong> Free (Trigger: An enemy cursed by your Warlock's Curse drops to 0 or fewer hit points)<br /><strong>Range:</strong> Personal</p>\n<p><strong>Effect:</strong> You gain a +1 bonus you can use on a d20 roll before the end of the next round.

Warlocks of these pacts can be expected to enforce cosmic law or collect lost and hidden knowledge.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Patron #1</strong> The Raven Queen is a mysterious Dolurrh native, known to scholars for the creation of Maruts. She seeks to hunt down those who would escape death, either through resurrection or transformative magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Patron #2</strong> The Supreme Archivist is the head librarian in the Eternal Archives on Daanvi, which meticulously catalogue all knowledge.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus At-Will</strong> You gain the <em>Bonds of Justice</em> power</p>\n<p><strong>Pact Boon</strong> You gain the <em>As Foretold</em> power</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>As Foretold</h4>\n<p><em>As one enemy falls, you set the stage for the next</em></p>\n<p>Level 1 Spell</p>\n<p>Arcane</p>\n<p><strong>Action:</strong> Free (Trigger: An enemy cursed by your Warlock's Curse drops to 0 or fewer hit points)<br /><strong>Range:</strong> Ranged 30' (Safe) ♦ <strong>Target:</strong> One creature</p>\n<p><strong>Effect:</strong> You slide the target 15'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Elemental</h3>\n<p>Elemental pacts are made with primordial lords. The lords reside on Fernia, Risia, and Kythri, and usually seek the return of artifacts stolen from their realms.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Patron #1</strong> Marrake al-Sidan al-Hariq ben Lazan rules the City of Brass in the heart of Fernia, with an addiction to gambling that can never be quenched</p>\n<p><strong>Example Patron #2</strong> Ymir rules the frost giants of Risia, and seeks to open a portal to Xen'drik to reclaim the giant kingdoms of old.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus At-Will</strong> You gain the <em>Frostfire Bolt</em> power</p>\n<p><strong>Pact Boon</strong> You gain the <em>Critical Mass</em> power</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Critical Mass</h4>\n<p><em>As an enemy falls, you use some of its life essence to make another more vulnerable to your attacks</em></p>\n<p>Level 1 Spell</p>\n<p>Arcane</p>\n<p><strong>Action:</strong> Free (Trigger: An enemy cursed by your Warlock's Curse drops to 0 or fewer hit points)<br /><strong>Range:</strong> Ranged 30' ♦ <strong>Target:</strong> One creature</p>\n<p><strong>Effect:</strong> The target gains vulnerability 3 to your choice of Fire or Cold. If the target already had vulnerability to the chosen element, it increases by 3. This vulnerability lasts until the end of the encounter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Fey</h3>\n<p>Fey Pacts are made with queens and kings of the wild. Most of these are from Thelanis, the realm of the Fae, but certain Thelanian spirits have taken an interest in Eberron.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Patron #1</strong> Shan Syraen, the Lord of Winter, resides in the feyspire Taer Syraen. He seeks to return his feyspire to Thelanis since it was stuck in Eberron after the Day of Mourning.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Patron #2</strong> The Elder Wolf despises Werewolves as corrupt, and seeks to purge them from existence</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus At-Will</strong> You gain the <em>Eyebite</em> power</p>\n<p><strong>Pact Boon</strong> You gain the <em>Wild Step</em> power</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Wild Step</h4>\n<p><em>As an enemy falls, you suddenly appear in a nearby location</em></p>\n<p>Level 1 Spell</p>\n<p>Arcane, Teleportation</p>\n<p><strong>Action:</strong> Free (Trigger: An enemy cursed by your Warlock's Curse drops to 0 or fewer hit points)<br /><strong>Range:</strong> Personal</p>\n<p><strong>Effect:</strong> You teleport a number of feet equal to 5 times your intelligence modifier</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Khyber</h3>\n<p>Khyber Pacts are made with fiends, demons, and devils of all kinds. While most fiends are native to Shavarath or Mabar, ancient evils native to Eberron yearn to break free.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Patron #1</strong> Sul Khatesh, the Keeper of Secrets lies imprisoned under Khorvaire. She grants mortals arcane power in exchange for unknown, future favors.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Patron #2</strong> The Lady of Sorrows rules a demense in Mabar, but desires the rarest of mortal tears</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus At-Will</strong> You gain the <em>Fell Gift</em> power</p>\n<p><strong>Pact Boon</strong> You gain the <em>Soul Feast</em> power</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Soul Feast</h4>\n<p><em>As an enemy falls, you gain unnatural resilience</em></p>\n<p>Level 1 Spell</p>\n<p>Arcane</p>\n<p><strong>Action:</strong> Free (Trigger: An enemy cursed by your Warlock's Curse drops to 0 or fewer hit points)<br /><strong>Range:</strong> Personal</p>\n<p><strong>Effect:</strong> You gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier plus one half your level</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Siberys</h3>\n<p>Siberys Pacts are made with forces of positive energy or otherwise considered \"good\". In addition to the immortal spirits of Shavarath and Irian, the Silver Flame and the Dragons of Argonessen occassionally grant mortals arcane power to fight the forces of darkness.</p>\n<p><strong>Example Patron #1</strong> Imperius of the Golden Host leads a regiment of archons on Shavarath.

If the target already had resistance to all damage, it increases by 5.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Mana</h2>\n<p>Unlike other power sources, arcane characters do not individually expend recharge spells. Instead, arcane characters have a pool of mana based on their level that they can use to cast their spells. Casting a spell involves expending mana equal to the spell's mana cost. Mana fully recharges on a long rest, but characters get some mana back whenever they complete a milestone. <em>(A milestone is completed for every two encounters completed since the last long rest)</em>.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse:collapse;width:100%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;\">Level</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;\">Mana pool</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;\">Mana recharge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;\">1-2</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;\">8</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;\">3-4</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;\">14</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;\">5-6</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;\">22</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;\">7-8</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;\">32</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;\">9-10</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;\">44</td>\n<td style=\"width:33.3333%;\">6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Like other classes, arcane characters can have up to six recharge powers and must replace old ones whenever they would gain another beyond the six.</p>\n<h2>Shadow Walk</h2>\n<p>Once per turn, if you move at least 15' away from where you started your turn, you gain concealment until the end of the next round.</p>\n<h2>Warlock's Curse</h2>\n<p>Warlock's gain strength from their enemies demise, cursing them to mark them for death</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Warlock's Curse</h4>\n<p><em>You whisper a word of dark power branding the target</em></p>\n<p>Warlock Feature</p>\n<p>Arcane</p>\n<p><strong>Action:</strong> Minor<br /><strong>Range:</strong> Ranged sight (safe) ♦ <strong>Target:</strong> Nearest enemy you can see</p>\n<p><strong>Effect:</strong> You curse the target, causing them to take an extra 1d6 damage from your attacks.

A warlock's curse lasts for 5 minutes or until the cursed enemy drops to 0 hit points or fewer. You can place a warlock's curse on multiple targets over the course of an encounter, with each curse requiring a separate use of this power. You can't place a warlock's curse on a creature that is already affected by your warlock's curse. The bonus damage increases by 1d6 every 5 levels, up to 6d6 at level 26.</p>\n</blockquote>\n","source":"Arcane","role":"Striker","keyAbilities":"Charisma, Constitution, Intelligence","defense":{"hpBase":11,"hpLevel":5,"surges":7,"fortitude":0,"reflex":0,"will":2},"features":{},"profs":{"armor":"Cloth, Leather","weapon":"Simple Melee, Simple Ranged","implement":"Daggers, Rods, Wands"}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","_id":"dxs9RBf0XxevumoO"}
