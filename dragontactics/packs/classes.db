Every time you attack an enemy, whether the attack hits or misses, you can choose to mark that target. The mark lasts until the end of your next turn <em>(While a target is marked, it takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls for any attack that doesn’t include you as a target)</em>. A creature can be subject to only one mark at a time. A new mark supersedes a mark that was already in place.</p>\n<p>In addition, whenever an enemy marked by you is adjacent to you and shifts or makes an attack that does not include you, you can make a melee basic attack against that enemy as an immediate interrupt.</p>\n<h2>Combat Mastery</h2>\n<p>Each fighter develops their own unique fighting style based on their training and personal preferences. Choose one of the following features.</p>\n<h3>Fighter Weapon Talent</h3>\n<p>Choose either one-handed or two-handed weapons. Your proficiency bonus for those weapons increases by 1.</p>\n<h3>Arena Training</h3>\n<p>You treat all weapons with which you are not proficient as improvised weapons. You gain a +2 proficiency bonus to attack rolls with improvised weapons. Your attacks with one- handed improvised weapons deal 1d8 damage, and your attacks with two-handed improvised weapons deal 1d10 damage. While you are not wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 21st level. You select two weapons as your arena weapons. If you are not already proficient with these weapons, you gain proficiency with them. In addition, any of your feats that grant feat bonuses to attack rolls or damage rolls with one of your arena weapons apply to your other arena weapon as well.</p>\n<h3>Battlerager Vigor</h3>\n<p>Whenever you hit an enemy with a melee or a close attack, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier, plus any temporary hit points normally granted by the power. You gain the hit points only after the attack is resolved. If you use an invigorating fighter attack power and miss every target with it, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. You gain the hit points only after the attack is resolved.</p>\n<h3>Brawler Style</h3>\n<p>While your off hand is free you can make the grab, shove, and bull rush actions as minor actions instead of standard.</p>\n<p>In addition, you gain the following power.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Drag</h4>\n<p><em>They chose the hard way</em></p>\n<p>Fighter Feature</p>\n<p>Martial</p>\n<p><strong>Action:</strong> Move Action<br /><strong>Special:</strong> You must be grabbing a creature<br /><strong>Range:</strong> Personal</p>\n<p><strong>Effect:</strong> You and the creature you are grabbing move up to 10'.

In addition you gain a +1 shield bonus to AC and Reflex. When wearing light armor or chainmail, you gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls with melee and close weapon attacks when you are wielding two weapons. This bonus increases to +2 with weapons that have the off-hand property</p>\n<h2>Combat Technique</h2>\n<p>Some fighters prefer to keep their friends close and their enemies closer, while others will chase their foes wherever they flee. Choose the <em>Combat Superiority</em> or <em>Combat Agility</em>class feature.</p>\n<h3>Combat Superiority</h3>\n<p>You gain a bonus to opportunity attacks equal to your Wisdom modifier. An enemy struck by your opportunity attack stops moving, if a move provoked the attack. If it still has actions remaining, it can use them to resume moving</p>\n<h3>Combat Agility</h3>\n<p>You gain the <em>Combat Agility</em> power</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Combat Agility</h4>\n<p><em>You follow an fleeing enemy and knock them down</em></p>\n<p>Fighter Feature</p>\n<p>Martial, Weapon</p>\n<p><strong>Action:</strong> Immediate Reaction (Trigger: An enemy adjacent to you takes an action that provokes an opportunity attack)<br /><strong>Range:</strong> Personal</p>\n<p><strong>Effect:</strong> You shift a number of feet equal to five times your Dexterity modifier.

Life essence can be spent to empower a Necromancer's powers, and is replenished through the Harvest power. You can have up to to two uses of life essence stored, and can restore two uses of life essence during a short rest by expending a healing surge without regaining any hitpoints. During a long rest there is no healing surge cost.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Harvest</h4>\n<p><em>You draw energy from a recently deceased corpse</em></p>\n<p>Necromancer Feature</p>\n<p>Shadow</p>\n<p><strong>Action:</strong> Minor<br /><strong>Range:</strong> Melee 5' ♦ <strong>Target:</strong> One recently deceased corpse</p>\n<p><strong>Effect:</strong> You drain the life essence out of the corpse, capturing the residual energy of its soul if it was a Beast, Humanoid, or Monster, the powering energy if it was Animate, or a bit of its essence if it was Immortal.

The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the power ends.<br />If you create an image it can emit sound but cannot recreate any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.<br />If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Investigation check against your competing Arcana check.
