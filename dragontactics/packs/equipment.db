First, poisons do not require endurance checks once per day - instead, poisons act on a faster timescale, as defined by the \"Period\" entry in the listing.</p>\n<p>Second, poisons have specific vectors through which they can affect a subject, as defined by the vector entry. Vectors include 'Contact', which means the poison can be absorbed through the skin of the subject. 'Ingested' poisons require the subject to eat or drink the poison. 'Inhalation' poisons can be used as a dust and must simply be breathed in. 'Injection' poisons require the poison to directly enter the blood stream of the subject, such as by being coated on an edged weapon and dealing damage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"long-term-conditions-poisons-crafting\">Crafting</h3>\n<p>During downtime periods player characters who both own poisoner's tools and have appropriate materials can craft poisons for which they have the appropriate formula. The cost of a poison depends on the level of Endurance DC's the character wishes. Severe poisons cost double an equivalent level of Mild poison. Crafting a batch of poison creates three doses, while just buying poisons only purchases one dose for the same cost.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, a character with competency in poisoner's tools can forage for materials during downtime, even if they do not have actual poisoner's tools.
