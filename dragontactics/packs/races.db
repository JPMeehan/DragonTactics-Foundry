{"name":"Yuan-Ti","permission":{"default":0,"DXmL7wc74NRmbZdk":3},"type":"race","data":{"description":"\n<h3>Xen'drik</h3>\n<p>Although they are relatively few in number, the intelligence and magical sophistication of the yuan-ti makes them a threat that cannot be easily dismissed. The yuan-ti arrived in Xen’drik as refugees, having been driven first from their homeland of Sarlona and then from Argonnessen. With every exodus, the personality of the yuan-ti grew darker and more hateful. In Eberron, it is a rare thing for an entire intelligent species to adhere to a single alignment; nonetheless, the yuan-ti of Xen’drik truly seem to be evil by nature.</p>\n<p>The Sarlonans claimed that the yuan-ti were shaped by one of the ancient lords of the Age of Demons. If this is true, then it’s possible that as the yuan-ti traveled from continent to continent, they passed over the tombs of additional demon lords, and each of these further infected the spirit of the race. In Argonnessen, Tiamat sunk her claws into the serpentfolk. In Xen’drik, they have been touched by the Scar that Abides (see page 156). If this is true, then the evil nature of the yuanti is in essence a curse—the touch of mighty fiends stretching back through the ages.</p>\n<p>The yuan-ti care nothing for these theories. They have no loyalty to the Lords of Dust or their masters, and they show equal disdain for the aberrations that flock to the banner of the Dragon Below. Proud and spiteful, the yuan-ti intend to wreak vengeance on all who have ever crossed them, from the dragons of Argonnessen to the humans whose ancestors drove them from Sarlona.</p>\n<p>For now, the yuan-ti are recovering from their humiliation in Argonnessen and building their strength. One mighty serpentine wizard has been developing an eldritch machine capable of transforming humanoids into reptilian creatures, wretches conditioned to be innately subservient to the yuan-ti. For the moment this work is still theoretical, and the wizard is testing elixirs and spells on captured travelers. If the machine is completed, Stormreach would make a tempting target; adventurers sailing into the harbor could find a city of bloodthirsty snakefolk.</p>\n<p>On a smaller scale, the yuan-ti are always looking for ways to turn the great powers of Eberron against one another, and they are especially eager to hurt the dragons of Argonnessen. The yuan-ti haven’t established a major presence in Stormreach, but it would be a simple matter for a pureblood to build a cult on Temple Row, or to start a new gang to compete with the Bilge Rats. In the rough-and-tumble streets of the Harbor district, these “Gutter Snakes” could easily glide beneath the public eye. Or they could go deeper still and lay claim to one of the dungeons below the city . . . though in doing so, they might risk waking a force even more ancient and evil than the yuan-ti.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Sarlona</h3>\n<p>Once the yuan-ti ruled kingdoms, but the Inspired turned the human population of central Sarlona against them during the Sundering. The race was almost eradicated, and many yuan-ti fled, first to Argonnessen and ultimately to Xen'drik. Those who remain are forced to cling to the shadows, concealing their true nature from the people around them.</p>\n<p>For the most part, the yuan-ti appear to want nothing more than solitude, but the Inspired teach their subjects to fear the scheming serpent people—and these fears might be justified. It is possible that some yuan-ti still seek to reclaim the glory of their past, and to overthrow those who laid them low . . . both the Inspired and humanity.</p>\n<p>Sarlona is home to two distinct breeds of yuan-ti. The serpent people of Syrkarn are traditional yuan-ti (MM 262), but few are evil. The shulassakar yuan-ti share traits with feathered serpents and are devoted to the couatl, following a religion very similar to the Silver Flame. Otherwise identical to standard yuan-ti, the shulassakar are covered with rainbow plumage. They also have different spell-like abilities: darkness and deeper darkness are replaced by light and daylight, respectively; cause fear is replaced by remove fear.</p>\n<p><strong>Yuan-Ti Lands</strong>: The yuan-ti are a race in hiding, and they have no open settlements. Most yuan-ti are found in their ancestral land of Syrkarn. The shulassakar are far fewer in number. They once resided in the kingdom of Khalesh, now a province of Riedra. Today, they are generally found in couatl ruins—protecting these sites from explorers while relying on the locales' defensive magic to shield them from the eyes of the Inspired.</p>\n","asi":"","size":"","speed":"","vision":"","languages":"","skill":"","competencies":"","features":{}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","_id":"06hP1MHhYDYBeeiq"}

{"name":"Giant","permission":{"default":0,"DXmL7wc74NRmbZdk":3},"type":"race","data":{"description":"\n<p>Eighty thousand years ago, the giants of [location:108279]built a civilization that has yet to be equaled in the modern day. Storm giant artificers and wizards created artifacts of incredible power and wondrous places far beyond the skill of the greatest magewrights of Khorvaire. This civilization was shattered forty thousand years ago. Today, the few surviving giants are largely barbarians, living in the glittering ruins of their glorious past.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Giants combine great size with great strength, giving them an unparalleled ability to wreak destruction upon anyone or anything unfortunate enough to get in their way.</p>\n<p>Giants have a reputation for crudeness and stupidity that is not undeserved, especially among the evil varieties. Most rely on their tremendous strength to solve problems, reasoning that any difficulty that won’t succumb to brute force isn’t worth worrying about. Giants usually subsist by hunting and raiding, taking what they like from creatures weaker than themselves.</p>\n<p>All giants speak Giant. Those with Intelligence scores of 10 or higher also speak Common.</p>\n<p>Giants relish melee combat. They favor massive two-handed weapons and wield them with impressive skill. They have enough cunning to soften up a foe with ranged attacks first, if they can. A giant’s favorite ranged weapon is a big rock.</p>\n<p>Solitary giants are often young adults striking out on their own. Gangs are usually made up of young adults who hunt or raid (or both) together. Giant bands are usually large or extended families. Sometimes a band contains unrelated young adults that the band has taken in as mates, servants, or guards.</p>\n<p>Giant tribes are similar to bands but have more members, plus contingents of guard creatures and nongiant servants. Hunting and raiding parties include guard creatures and may be made up of giants from different tribes working together.</p>\n<p>About a third of the giants in a band or tribe are giant children, who can be formidable creatures in their own right.</p>\n<h2>First Impressions</h2>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Encountering a giant can be an awe-inspiring and disorienting experience. First comes a rhythmic booming, felt more than heard, that resolves slowly into the sound of footsteps: a giant is near! Loose stones vibrate and tumble down the hillside. Trees sway, then bend aside as the colossus emerges. How can anything be that big? Is it a trick of perspective?</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body--Extra-Space-After-\">When giants first appear before a band of adventurers, they demonstrate the qualities that make them spectacularto behold:</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Hanging\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Giants Are Huge.</span></strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\"></span>Most giants can easily peer in a second-floor window. The larger ones would have to stoop to get down to that level! A giant’s metal hammer could serve as an anvil for a human smith, and a giant’s shield is bigger and heavier than a feasting table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Hanging\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Giants Are Heavy.</span></strong>If a giant sits on a wagon, its wheels and axles are liable to snap like twigs. A giant can crush a house or capsize a ship simply by carelessly shifting its weight. An ox that strays too close to a sleeping giant could wind up pinned or crushed if the giant rolls oversuddenly.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Hanging\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Giants Are Loud.</span></strong>The footsteps of giants in the distance are often initially mistaken for thunder, even on a clear day. The sounds of a giant beating a weapon against its shield and bellowing a challenge to foes are strident enough to knock dishes from shelves and rattle doors in their frames.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Hanging\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Giants Are Strong.</span></strong>A charging warhorse at full gallop, capable of bowling over a line of human warriors, merely crumples against the bulk of a giant. A giant could kick a cart with enough force to send it smashing through a house, and a giant’s club — the size of, if not actually, an entire tree — could level the same house with a single blow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"TheGiantTongue\" class=\"compendium-hr\">The Giant Tongue</h2>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The language that giants share is one of the few remnants from their once-grand empire. Over time it has fragmented into many dialects, and each type has its own distinctive accent, but giants of different types can generally understand one another.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Any non-giant who learns the Giant language can converse with all types of giants, but giants sometimes have a hard time hearing the tiny voices of human-sized creatures, and some vowel sounds emitted by giants are nearly impossible to reproduce for any creature that doesn’t have lungs as large as beer barrels.</p>\n<h3 id=\"MaatandMaug\" class=\"quick-menu-exclude compendium-hr\">Maat and Maug</h3>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Two words have special significance in the Giant language and the giants’ worldview. Neither one of them translates directly into Common or any other language, because their definitions encompass several related concepts.<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Maat</span>(pronounced<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">mott</span>) is the term giants use to describe ideas, behaviors, creatures, and objects that they consider good, holy, honorable, or desirable.<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Maug</span>(pronounced<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">mog</span>) is the counterpart term, embodying what other languages call evil, unholy, dishonorable, or undesirable.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Individual giants aren’t necessarily thought of as maat or maug by their kin. What matters isn’t a giant’s personal philosophy but its standing within the ordning, which is influenced by behavior and attitude but also by a host of other factors. Every individual commits both maat and maug acts, and rises or falls in the ordning as a consequence. A giant isn’t judged by other giants on the basis of whether what it did was inherently good or evil, but on whether its actions enhanced or diminished the qualities giants admire — the “giantness,” if you will — in themselves and their clans.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A storm giant, for example, might see the raiding practices of hill giants as distasteful but not maug, because brutal raiding is an inborn trait of the hill giants. If those same hill giants worshiped Yeenoghu, however, that act would represent a flagrant turning away from the traditions of the ordning. Hill giants who choose that path make themselves maug.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Non-giants are considered maug out of hand and must usually prove themselves maat to gain a giant’s respect.</p>\n<h3 id=\"RunesandTaleCarvings\" class=\"quick-menu-exclude compendium-hr\">Runes and Tale Carvings</h3>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For much of their written communication, giants use a modified version of the runic letterforms claimed by the dwarves as their own. This alphabet is used widely today, including by many traditional enemies of the dwarves such as orcs, giants, and goblinoids. That giants were first in the world and thus the creators of the script is a fact that giants take for granted but which dwarves hotly dispute.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Many giants are illiterate or nearly so — particularly hill, frost, and fire giants, which place little value on learning. Instead of writing stories with words, they typically tell their tales with pictograms etched in wood, ice, stone, or even earth, in the case of hill giants. These “tale carvings” relate legends or the stories of important events or meetings in the manner of highly sophisticated cave paintings. Often they employ aspects of legends about the giant pantheon. For example, Memnor’s face or head floating above the shoulders of another giant indicates that the giant was a liar or a deceiver; a depiction of Iallanis being stabbed in the back represents the betrayal of love. Such symbols and visual allegories are well understood by giants, but they can be indecipherable to viewers who aren’t steeped in the giants’ mythology. Most non-giants find a tale carving as unintelligible as giants would find poetry writtenin Elvish.</p>\n<h2 class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Giants and Magic</h2>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Giants have a paradoxical relationship with magic. The most outwardly magical are the cloud giants, followed closely by storm giants. Both types have an innate ability to use some forms of magic related to air, weather, and gravity. Very few giants, however, study magic in the way that humans, dwarves, and elves do. Arcane scholarship by itself isn’t acknowledged by the ordning; it isn’t maug, but it isn’t maat, either. Mastering the secrets of magic, though, demands a degree of devotion that would take giants away from pursuits that are valued by the ordning. As a consequence, it’s a path rarely taken.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The exception is rune magic. Giants are drawn to the solidity and permanence of magical runes. Stone giants are great practitioners of rune carving, both because of the artistry it demands and because their environment is perfect for its use. At least a few<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">skiltgravr</span>(“rune cutters”) can be found among any type of giants, even the slow-witted hill giants who stomp enormous marks into hillsides or gouge them into theirown flesh.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Crafting this form of magic is painstakingly slow. Imagine a wizard who crafts a scroll and who eschews the convenience of parchment and ink in favor of stone and chisel, glacier and axe, or ironand forge.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Carving a magical rune into an item imbues it with power. Like any other magic item, it can be used to activate one or more magical effects. A magical rune can also be inscribed upon a surface to create effects similar to those of a<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">glyph of warding</span>or<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">symbol</span>spell. The rune itself determines what sort of magic the item or surface holds. For example, a storm rune carved into a stone might allow the stone’s possessor to control the weather. The same rune carved into door or chest might deal thunder damage to anyone whoopens it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A Giant's Bag</h2>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A giant on the move always has a sack slung over its shoulder. The primary purpose of a giant’s bag is to carry food. With such an enormous belly to feed (particularly in the case of hill giants), it’s unwise for a giant to travel without a supply of nourishment.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body--Extra-Space-After-\">Giants also carry rocks in their bags: a few for battle, a few others for hunting, and one or two special ones for games. Beyond that, a bag might contain anything: tools, mementos, items for trade, or merely curios the giant wanted to bring along. Some possible contents are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A live pig</li>\n<li>Threebear skins</li>\n<li>Longsword wrapped in a blood-caked cloak (used as a knife)</li>\n<li>Keg of ale</li>\n<li>Caged halfling (foramusement)</li>\n<li>Chest full of broken window glass</li>\n<li>Human’s backpack filledwith coins</li>\n<li>Skull ofan owlbear</li>\n<li>Large bundle of dry wood tied upwith vines</li>\n<li>A once-fine tapestry that’s now tattered from being usedas a towel</li>\n<li>Four mostly intact wagon wheels</li>\n<li>A tombstone (for skipping across water)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Champions of Rock Throwing</h2>\n<p>Giants have a well-deserved reputation as living siege engines — all of them can hurl boulders with accuracy across great distances. Rock throwing — for battle, hunting, and sport — is a tradition that goes back to the ancient times of the giants. Other races developed the sling, the spear-thrower, or the bow to artificially improve the strength and accuracy of their ranged attacks, but giants never perceived a need for mechanical assistance. Even in places where giants have adapted bows or javelins for use in combat, they’ve never neglected the straightforward strategy of picking up a rock and letting it fly. Few activities, in fact, seem to give them as much satisfaction as the simple act of tossingboulders.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Most of the games that giants play involve throwing rocks in ways that hone their skills for hunting and war. One of the most popular contests, especially among fire giants, involves nothing more than taking turns trying to knock each other down with boulders. Frost giants build targets out of snow and ice and compete to see who can knock down the most with a single toss. A popular one-on-one game begins with the challenger throwing a stone as far as it can. The giant who was challenged then goes to where the stone landed and hurls it back at the challenger. A challenger who is stronger wins, because the return throw will fall short, but a giant who took on a better thrower will stumble away, nursing its injuries, as a lesson that arrogance has a price.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In battle against puny creatures, giants use boulders that fit in one hand. When giants fight enormous foes (such as dragons) or enormous targets (such as castles), they prefer to hurl stones so large that even a giant must use both arms to lift and throw one. Giants throw just as accurately with both arms as with one, a feat most humans would find impossible. These attacks are effective only at shorter ranges, however, for obvious reasons.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When they hunt by rock throwing, giants use smaller stones, about the size of a human head, that can kill an elk or a bear without smashing itinto pulp.</p>\n<h2 class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">How to Lay a Giant Low</h2>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A force allied with giants — or worse, a force made up of giants — is one of the most fearsome opponents on the battlefield. The giants can rain boulders onto an enemy from a distance where only skilled archers, heavy siege weapons, or spellcasters can strike back at them.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At first blush, it might seem that a potent wizard would make the best giant-killer, but few spellcasters can stand up to a giant in direct confrontation. One might do harm to a giant, but odds are it will survive the one or two spells that can be thrown at it before a well-placed boulder or the swing of an enormous club quashes the threat.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Among those with experience fighting giants, dwarves have developed the most effective tactics. To defeat a giant, dwarves rely on prolonged, accurate, massed archery (favoring heavy crossbows for such work), fast-moving cavalry that can force the giant into a disadvantageous position, or fanatical troops armed with pole arms, ropes, and grappling hooks. If a giant can be tripped or pulled down — preferably onto its belly so it’s less able to defend itself — then it can be entangled in nets and cables and disabled by concentrated attacks on its headand neck.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">On the other side of the field, giants understand that smaller foes will try to target their legs and lower bodies. Thus, when they head into a fight against human-sized opponents, they don thick boots, greaves, armored codpieces, and wide, heavy hide or metal belts to protect their bellies. Even savage hill giants peel thick bark from trees and strap it around their legs and dangle logs or stones from their belts to make the going more perilous for an enemy that tries to getunderfoot.</p>\n","asi":"","size":"","speed":"","vision":"","languages":"","skill":"","competencies":"","features":{}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","_id":"6nGvehlblXlF0XRo"}

When the human vessel dies or is destroyed, the quori spirit, unharmed, returns to its home plane of Dal Quor until it can inhabit another suitable vessel.</p>\n<p>The quori originally had trouble projecting their minds into the Material Plane. Unwilling to permanently join with a human host as the kalashtar did, the quori sought another solution. That solution was to use controlled breeding and psionic manipulation to spawn highly evolved Riedran humans tinged with elf and fiendish blood. These perfect quori vessels possess otherworldly beauty and a penchant for cruelty. Unpossessed hosts, known as empty vessels, train hard for the day they receive their quori spirits. While quori prefer to fill Inspired vessels, and needed such vessels to originally project to Eberron, they have developed the ability to possess any willing human.</p>\n<p>An Inspired vessel is taller than the average human, but lightly built, with large, almond-shaped eyes that vary in color.

Although they are omnivores, lizardfolk prefer meat; popular lore holds that lizardfolk prefer humanoid flesh, but this charge is largely unfounded (though some tribes do eat captives or slain foes). Some more advanced tribes build huts and use a variety of weapons and shields; leaders of these tribes may have equipment stolen from or obtained in trade with other intelligent creatures.</p>\n<p>A lizardfolk is usually 6 to 7 feet tall with green, gray, or brown scales. Its tail is used for balance and is 3 to 4 feet long. A lizardfolk can weigh from 200 to 250 pounds.</p>\n<p>Lizardfolk speak Draconic.</p>\n<p>Lizardfolk have a patriarchal society in which the most powerful member rules the others. Shamans offer advice but rarely become leaders themselves. Survival is the utmost concern of lizardfolk, and a threatened or starving tribe will go to incredible lengths (even committing deeds considered abominable by other humanoids) to ensure its continued existence.</p>\n<p>Most tribes live in swamps, but about a third of the population lives in underwater air-filled caves. Local tribes often unite against a greater threat (including hostile lizardfolk tribes) and occasionally make alliances with locathahs or serve more powerful creatures such as nagas or dragons. In isolated areas they survive by fishing, gathering, and scavenging, while those that live near other humanoids make raids for food, supplies, and slaves. A lizardfolk lair has half as many noncombatant hatchlings as adults, and one egg per ten adults.</p>\n<h3>4e Monster Manual</h3>\n<p>LIZARDFOLK INHABIT SWAMPS AND MARSHES, feeding on local wildlife and driving off or killing trespassers entering their territory. Some especially cruel and savage lizardfolk capture and eat other humanoid creatures, boldly launching raids against the lands of nearby humanoids to capture victims for their feasts.</p>\n<p>Lizardfolk excel at swimming and often take to the water to stalk prey and evade pursuit. They can hold their breath for up to ten minutes without trouble.</p>\n<p>Lizardfolk come in many varieties, including greenscale lizardfolk (the most common breed) and blackscales. Blackscales are dumb, hulking brutes that often inhabit the same swamps and marshes as their smaller kin. A blackscale tribe might be an enemy to a lizardfolk tribe, but more often the two work together or even intermingle in the same village. Blackscales rarely become leaders of mixed tribes since they are simply too dull-witted for the job, but they frequently accompany raiding parties or serve as bodyguards to the tribal chieftain or marsh mystic.</p>\n<p>Lizardfolk favor humid climates. They dwell in warm or temperate marshes, swamps, and jungles, or more rarely in flooded cavern systems.</p>\n<p>Lizardfolk occasionally trade with humanoids they trust (usually halflings), bartering for finished goods. However, tribes that prey on other humanoids generally don’t engage in any kind of trade.</p>\n<p>Lizardfolk hatch from eggs and grow quickly to adulthood; by 2 years of age, they are fully grown. A tribe maintains a communal incubator in which all the tribe’s eggs are sealed together. Young lizardfolk are raised together by the whole tribe. Parental relationships do not exist among lizardfolk.</p>\n<p>Lizardfolk have a patriarchal society in which the most powerful member rules the others as chieftain. Shamans and mystics commonly advise the chieftain.</p>\n<p>Lizardfolk do not worship gods, but large tribes often elevate one of their own to the status of a living deity. This figure becomes the tribe’s lizard king. A lizard king usually possesses unusual strength, ferocity, and cleverness and might be tainted by primordial or demonic influences. Powerful reptilian creatures such as dragons sometimes usurp this role and command a tribe’s loyalty.</p>\n<h3>5e Monster Manual</h3>\n<p>Lizardfolk are primitive reptilian humanoids that lurk in the swamps and jungles of the world. Their hut villages thrive in forbidding grottos, half-sunken ruins, and watery caverns.</p>\n<p><strong>Territorial Xenophobes.</strong>Lizardfolk deal and trade with other races only rarely. Fiercely territorial, they use camouflaged scouts to guard the perimeter of their domain. When unwelcome visitors are detected, a tribe sends a hunting band to harass or drive the trespassers off, or tricks them into blundering into the lairs of crocodiles and other dangerous creatures.</p>\n<p>Lizardfolk have no notion of traditional morality, and they find the concepts of good and evil utterly alien. Truly neutral creatures, they kill when it is expedient and do whatever it takes to survive.</p>\n<p>Lizardfolk rarely stray beyond their claimed hunting grounds. Any creature that enters their territory is fair game to be stalked, killed, and devoured. They make no distinction between humanoids, beasts, and monsters. Similarly, lizardfolk don't like reaching too fa r beyond their borders, where they could easily become the hunted instead of the hunters.</p>\n<p>Occasions might arise when lizard folk will form alliances with their neighbors. These lizardfolk usually learn firsthand that humans, dwarves, halflings, and elves can sometimes prove helpful or trustworthy. Once lizardfolk forge ties with outsiders, they are steadfast and fierce allies.</p>\n<p><strong>Great Feasts and Sacrifices.</strong> Lizard folk are omnivorous, but they have a taste for humanoid flesh. Prisoners are often taken back to their camps to become the centerpieces of great feasts and rites involving dancing, storytelling, and ritual combat. Victims are either cooked and eaten by the tribe, or are sacrificed to Semuanya, the lizardfolk god.</p>\n<p><strong>Canny Grafters.</strong>Though they aren't skilled artisans, lizardfolk craft tools and ornamental jewelry out of the bones of their kills, and they use the hides and shells of dead monsters to create shields.</p>\n<p><strong>Lizardfolk Leaders.</strong>Lizardfolk respect and fear magic with a religious awe. Lizardfolk shamans lead their tribes, overseeing rites and ceremonies performed to honor Semuanya. From time to time, however, a lizardfolk tribe produces a powerful figure touched not by Semuanya but by Sess'inek-a reptilian demon lord who seeks to corrupt and control the lizardfolk.</p>\n<p>Lizard folk born in Sess'inek's image are larger and more cunning than other lizardfolk, and are thoroughly evil. These lizard kings and queens dominate lizardfolk tribes, usurping a shaman's authority and inspiring uncharacteristic aggression among their subjects.</p>\n<p><strong>Dragon Worshipers.</strong>Lizardfolk speak Draconic, which they are thought to have learned from dragons in ancient times. A tribe that wanders into the territory of a dr,agon will offer it tribute to win its favor. An evil dragon might exploit lizardfolk for its own vile ends, turning them into raiders and plunderers.</p>\n","asi":"","size":"","speed":"","vision":"","languages":"","skill":"","competencies":"","features":{}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","_id":"DVILVHz0LfW4GPmB"}

{"name":"Kobold","permission":{"default":0,"DXmL7wc74NRmbZdk":3},"type":"race","data":{"description":"\n<p><em>The black-scaled sorcerer barked a harsh Draconic syllable and a wave of invisible force slammed Daine against the wall, pinning him against the rough stone. His captor sneered, needle teeth flashing.</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Thinking to walk the deep tunnels alone and unseen,\" the kobold sneered. \"Khyber whispers and warns, and so you are found. Dead now, by his hand.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>Daine gasped in pain as the mystical bonds grew tighter, squeezing the breath from his lungs . . . .</em></p>\n<p>The kobolds of Khorvaire trace their history to the dawn of Eberron. According to ancient legend, kobolds were formed from the drops of blood shed in the battle between Eberron, Siberys, and Khyber. A new generation of dragons descended from Siberys, Khyber brought forth fiends and horrors, and Eberron gave birth to the creatures of nature -- but the kobolds were already there, spawned from the first battle. True or not, this myth is the driving force behind kobold psychology and culture.</p>\n<p>Two subraces of kobold exist in Khorvaire: the iredar (Draconic for \"ones of earth\"), who trace their ancestry to Eberron, and the irvhir (Draconic for \"ones below\") that descend from Khyber. These two races share a common appearance, but each race has a distinctive body odor that kobolds can instantly detect; in fact, a kobold can automatically identify the subrace of any other kobold within 15 feet. A character with long experience with kobolds can distinguish these scents by making a successful DC 20 Wisdom check; if the creature possesses the scent ability, the DC of this check is reduced to 10. Kobolds find the scent of others of their kind to be soothing, and kobolds that spend long periods of time away from their own kind often become depressed.</p>\n<p>Beyond scent, the key distinction between the kobold subraces is supernatural. Kobolds produce a surprising number of sorcerers, which is a phenomenon they attribute to their supposed bond to the progenitor dragons. Irvhir sorcerers typically possess spells tied to corruption and darkness, while iredar sorcerers usually have powers of defense and binding. This is not an absolute rule, and a kobold PC can take any spell that she desires. However, an iredar kobold that makes use of spells such as<em>fear</em>,<em>darkness</em>, or<em>chilling touch</em>may be viewed with suspicion by her companions, who see these as the powers of the Dragon Below.</p>\n<p>Stories are told of a third subrace of kobolds: the irsvern (Draconic for \"ones above\"), children of Siberys. According to legend, these kobolds have wings and live in hidden communities on the peaks of the tallest mountains. In 867 YK, Tolas Koln of the Wayfinder Foundation set out to recover a copy of the<em>Talarash Siberys</em>said to reside in an abandoned draconic temple in the Ironroot Mountains, andthe last entry in the expedition journal describes an encounter with winged kobolds with astonishing sorcerous powers<em>.</em>Some say that this is a documented encounter with the irsvern kobolds, while others dismiss it as a hoax perpetrated by Koln himself.</p>\n<p>Outsiders often assume that kobolds are primitive and savage since they live in unmodified caverns and rely on oral tradition instead of written records. Also, they live in small tribal communities and have never come together to create cities, nations, or empires. However, kobolds are just as sophisticated as humans or gnomes. While they prefer to live in natural environments instead of creating artificial structures, kobolds have a great gift for mining and stoneworking, and they often fill their lairs with cunning traps. But their culture is driven by tradition, and the kobolds have never sought to change or progress. They are the children of the dragons, vessels of the progenitors' will; change will come when the great dragons mandate it.</p>\n<p><strong>Lands:</strong>To date, kobold communities have been encountered in Q'barra and in the Seawall Mountains between Darguun and Zilargo. However, kobolds are extremely reclusive, and recent events suggest that kobold communities are hidden across Khorvaire.</p>\n<p><strong>Settlements:</strong>The kobolds of Eberron prefer to live in natural caverns. The irvhir kobolds make their homes deep beneath the surface, while the iredar kobolds usually live in mountain caves. The kobolds believe that these caverns are the veins of the progenitor dragons, and they often carve elaborate draconic designs on the walls. Kobolds prefer to live in tribes containing approximately 100 adults. The largest communities can have up to 600 adults. Generally, though, a community splits once its population rises too far above 100 adults, with younger kobolds moving away to found a new community.</p>\n<p>Kobolds bond with horrid animals. Horrid creatures -- especially burrowing animals such as rats, weasels, and badgers -- are frequently found in kobold communities.</p>\n<p><strong>Power Groups:</strong>Kobold culture revolves around three forces. The stonescales (or ternmolik, in Draconic) perform the day-to-day tasks required for the survival of a community: crafts, agriculture, and the gathering of food when agriculture will not suffice. The claws (gix) are soldiers and hunters. And the blood seers (iejirastrix) are mystics who hear the voices of the progenitor dragons -- sorcerers, druids, and favored souls whose magical powers are seen as proof of the kobolds' divine ancestry.</p>\n<p>Typically the chieftain of a village is an old claw, though in a peaceful region a stonescale can hold the post. The chieftain manages the daily affairs of the community while the blood seers link the communities together. Seers often travel from village to village to meet with other blood seers, discussing their visions and issues affecting the race as a whole.</p>\n<p>One other force that has an impact on kobold culture: the Chamber. While most dragons dismiss the kobold's claims of draconic ancestry, kobold blood seers can have strange (though often distorted) insights into the Draconic Prophecy, and the Chamber occasionally makes use of kobold agents. This can result in teams of kobolds equipped with powerful magic weapons and items -- an unpleasant surprise for a group of adventurers that underestimates the little reptiles.</p>\n<p><strong>Beliefs:</strong>Mainstream kobold culture is oriented around the worship of a particular progenitor dragon. The irvhir tradition is one of the oldest cults of the Dragon Below, though it has no connection with the aberration-oriented cults of the Shadow Marches. The iredar kobolds revere Eberron as the source of life and nature; this is a unique druidic tradition with no ties to the sects of the Eldeen Reaches.</p>\n<p>The kobolds see themselves as the hands of the progenitors in the modern age. And in the past, visions of the blood seers have often been tied to the Draconic Prophecy. It is a mystery, since the kobolds themselves rarely understand the significance of their actions -- but even the Chamber respects this uncanny gift.</p>\n<p>Of course, not all kobolds are bound to these beliefs. A few tribes have split off from these traditions, ignoring the words of the blood seers. Irvhir kobolds often turn to the worship of the Shadow or the Mockery, while independent iredar revere Boldrei and Olladra.</p>\n<p><strong>Language:</strong>Kobolds speak Draconic. There is no evidence of the kobolds ever having possessed another language or having been taught by dragons. Most kobolds love to talk, and a meal with a group of kobolds is a deluge of yapping voices.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations:</strong>Most kobolds prefer to avoid contact with the outside world. Irvhir kobolds are especially xenophobic, and the miners of Zilargo have been fighting irvhir kobolds for centuries. Iredar kobolds are more moderate in their views. They have little interest in foreign cultures and fight irvhir kobolds as often as they battle gnomes or humans.</p>\n<p>In the wake of the Last War, kobolds have had more active presence on the surface of Khorvaire. Kobold scavengers often rummage through battlefields and ruined villages. Previously unknown irvhir communities have risen from the depths to strike at weakened thorps and hamlets along the borders of the Mournland. Whether these are random attacks of opportunity or driven by the seers of Khyber remains to be seen.</p>\n<p><strong>Classes:</strong>Kobold soldiers are typically warriors. Kobold combat techniques focus on speed as opposed to strength, and exceptional hunters are often swashbucklers, scouts, or rangers. Clerics and adepts are rare since kobolds favor druids and favored souls. The kobolds have no tradition of wizardry, but they produce a remarkable number of powerful sorcerers. While all blood seers are spellcasters, not all sorcerers become seers. But all kobold sorcerers are considered blessed by the progenitor and usually become the champions of their tribes.</p>\n<h3>Roleplaying a Khorvaire Kobold</h3>\n<p>When playing a kobold -- either as a PC or NPC -- consider a few things first. If you are alone, why have you left your tribe? Have you abandoned the beliefs of your people, or are you on a quest? Perhaps the blood seers believe you have an important destiny to fulfill -- but it requires you to live among the warm.</p>\n<p>Kobolds recognize that they are physically weaker than most other races, and they rely on cunning to win battles. Treacherous tactics are not shameful: They are a sign of intelligence. This applies to social situations as well as combat. When dealing with non-kobolds, a kobold lies and cheats without a second thought. Your wits are your weapons: Use them!</p>\n<p>As a kobold, balance arrogance with caution. Your people have a divine heritage that places you on an equal footing with dragons. On the other hand, divine heritage doesn't do much when you're arguing with an angry bugbear. So flaunt your superiority when you can, but know your limits!</p>\n","asi":"","size":"","speed":"","vision":"","languages":"","skill":"","competencies":"","features":{}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","_id":"LZ5bfs65GcUIfHx1"}

They are slim, and even the strongest simply look athletic rather than musclebound. They have the same range of complexions as humans, though they are more often fair than dark. Their straight, fine hair is often white, silver, or pale gold, and they wear it long and loose. Their ears are long and pointed, and their eyes are pearly and opalescent orbs of vibrant blue, violet, or green, lacking pupils. Eladrin can’t grow facial hair and have little body hair.</p>\n<p>Eladrin children grow much as human children do, but their aging process slows to a crawl when they reach maturity.

At certain conjunctions between the Feywild and Eberron, the gleaming towers of the feyspires would appear, allowing the eladrin within to emerge and experience the world. Sometimes, a few eladrin would stay, succumbing to the beauty of a place or the charm of its people. At other times, leaving the feyspires was not a choice, such as when giants conquered Shae Tirias Tolai, the City of Silver and Bone. That feyspire appeared in the wilds of Xen'drik, and giants seized the opportunity to attack and take the population of Shae Tirias Tolai into captivity. The race of elves descended from these displaced eladrin.</p>\n<p>Eladrin have had little historical or social impact on Eberron. Before the war, when the feyspires appeared in Eberron, their inhabitants would emerge to trade with nearby settlements. This casual relationship with the world might have continued had the feyspires not been present in Eberron on the Day of Mourning. On that day, the feyspires were severed from the Thelanis, becoming permanent parts of the landscape of Eberron. The displaced eladrin are now adjusting to their new circumstances or are searching desperately for a way back to the Feywild.</p>\n<h3>Eladrin Lands</h3>\n<p>There are six feyspires known to exist in Khorvaire.

Fur covers a minotaur's upper body, coarse and thick on the head and neck, gradually thinning around the shoulders until it becomes humanlike hair over the arms and upper torso. The thick hair turns shaggy once more at the minotaur's waist and thickens around the loins and legs, with tufts at the end of the tail and around the powerful hooves. Minotaurs take pride in their horns, the sharpness, size, and color of which are related to an individual's place in minotaur society. Fur and skin coloring runs from albino white to coal black, though most minotaurs have red or brown fur and hair.</p>\n<p>Labyrinthine patterns are important to minotaurs, and these decorations appear on their clothing, armor, and weapons, and sometimes even on their hides. Each pattern is particular to a clan, and the pattern's size and complexity help minotaurs iden­tify family allegiance and caste. The patterns evolve through the generations, growing more expansive based on clan members' deeds and a clan's history.</p>\n<p>Minotaurs live as long as humans do.</p>\n<h3>Background and History</h3>\n<p>The origin of minotaurs is clouded by history - possibly originating in Sarlona or Xen'drik, the largest modern populations can be found in Droamm. As with many Droammish races, most people of the five nations imagine bestial worshippers of dark powers when they think of minotaurs. The reality is more complicated - the relationship between minotaurs and their dark worship isn't as binary as the gnolls. The savage call is less overwhelming but is also harder to completely break, leading many minotaurs to live their entire lives treading that line of order and chaos.</p>\n<h3>Minotaur Lands</h3>\n<p>A few clans of minotaurs live in the wilder regions of Khorvaire, Sarlona, and Xen'drik, but the greater part of Eberron's minotaurs inhabit Droaam. They are found within most of that region's major communities. The minotaur warlord Rhesh Turakbar also claims several territories in the region. Although Turakbar's minotaurs are violent demon-worshipers, many of Droaam's other minotaurs have personalities and beliefs more agreeable to other races. House Tharashk and the militias of Droaam respect minotaurs for their strength and their sense of honor and use them as mercenaries.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"races-minotaur-goring-charge\">Goring Charge</h3>\n<p><em>You charge horns first</em></p>\n<p><strong>Encounter</strong>Racial Power</p>\n<p>Racial</p>\n<p><strong>Action:</strong>Standard<br /><strong>Range</strong>: Personal</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong>: You charge and make the following attack in place of a melee basic attack</p>\n<p><strong>Range: </strong>Melee 5'<strong><br />Attack</strong>: Strength, Constitution, or Dexterity vs. Fortitude</p>\n<p><strong>Hit</strong>: 1d8 + Strength damage, and you knock the target prone</p>\n<p><strong>Special</strong>: The damage dice on this power increases to 2d8 at level 11 and to 3d8 at level 21</p>\n</blockquote>\n","asi":"+2 Strength, +2 Constitution or Wisdom","size":"Medium (Height: 7’4”-6’0” Weight: 130-170 lbs.)","speed":"30'","vision":"Normal","languages":"Common, Goblin","skill":"+2 Perception","competencies":"Knowledge of Geography (Greater Khorvaire)","features":{"Ferocity":{"key":"Ferocity","label":"Ferocity","value":"When you drop to 0 hit points or fewer, you can make a melee basic attack as an immediate interrupt"},"HeedlessCharge":{"key":"HeedlessCharge","label":"Heedless Charge","value":"You have a +2 bonus to AC against opportunity attacks you provoke during a charge"}}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","_id":"Q4FyVRFDJZbOWJBS"}

This dark kingdom was already weakened by civil war, and the forces of the Inspired took down the city-states of Ohr Kaluun one by one. In what seemed to be an act of charity, a Shadow Lord named Kul Uulan opened his war maze to the refugees of fallen cities, suggesting that they might still find victory through unity. The truth was far more macabre. Uulan sacrificed thousands of refugees in a ghastly ritual calling for the blessing and protection of the Dark Six. When the soldiers of the Riedran Alliance came to Uulan's maze, they found no trace of his people; even clairsentience proved useless. Soldiers were killed, and word spread of evil spirits haunting the broken mazes. In time, the truth came to light. Uulan's people hadn't vanished: they'd been transformed. Through the blood sacrifice of thousands of innocents, Uulan had gained a terrible power for his own people. They had become the skulks.</p>\n<p>The skulks of Riedra believe that they are the chosen people of the Dark Six, blessed and shielded by the deities others fear. Although the skulks revere all of the Six, they typically select one as a personal patron and seek to emulate that force in all ways. The Mockery inspires the most followers, and the skulks who idolize the flayed god are terrifying indeed. Those skulks who follow the Shadow often pursue arcane knowledge; the most dangerous members of the Heirs of Ohr Kaluun are often skulk wizards. Nonetheless, the skulks have never posed a serious threat to the Inspired. They are paranoid creatures who revere madness, treachery, and destruction. They have trouble forming large communities, as rivalries and feuds quickly arise. The skulks love to kill Riedrans—but when there are no Riedrans about, they soon turn on each other.</p>\n<p>Although most skulks are content with their savage life amid the ruins, a few seek something more. Some of these skulks end up working with the Dream Merchants, while others simply wander. A few seek to atone for the dark deeds of their ancestors; it's said that a handful of skulk guides have been seen on the Summit Road in recent years.</p>\n<p><strong>Skulk Lands</strong>: Skulks are scattered across Sarlona, but they are found in significant numbers only on the islands of Ohr Kaluun.

{"name":"Warforged","permission":{"default":0,"DXmL7wc74NRmbZdk":3},"type":"race","data":{"description":"\n<h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>\n<p>Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. All warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. A sigil is engraved into the center of the forehead; this is unique to each warforged. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed.</p>\n<p>Juggernaut models are bigger and typically incorporate adamantine into the design, bulking the Warforged up for combat. Psiforged bear similar resemblance to the standard Envoy models, but have large shards of crystals embedded within their systems. Scouts are much smaller than other warforged and incorporate mithral into their design.</p>\n<h3>Background and History</h3>\n<p>Warforged were invented during The Last War as soldiers constructed by House Cannith. Early variations were just variations on golems, barely thinking constructs only capable of following simple orders. A breakthrough by the senior Merrix d'Cannith blended organic and inorganic materials to create the modern Warforged, fully possessing sentience.</p>\n<p>The breakthrough that led to<em>Creation Forges</em>isn't fully understood, and came with quite a few unintended consequences. The Ghulra that adorns their forehead is a symbol unique to each warforged, like a human fingerprint. Furthermore, Warforged are fully capable of independent thought, which was not the intention for a new brand of constructed soldiers.</p>\n<p>Warforged rights have changed significantly as the people of the five nations came to understand that these weren't just automata but living beings. The Treaty of Thronehold, which ended The Last War in 996, officially banned the operation of<em>Creation Forges</em>and officially freed all Warfoged. However, because most Warforged had only known working for their entire lives, many have effectively become indentured servants or stayed in the military.</p>\n<p>The Psiforged were never an intended product of the creation forges - the source of the crystals remains unknown, as no psionically attuned crystals were fed into the creation forges. The five progenitors, the original five psiforged, have disappeared in the ten years since their appearance, while the Mourning wiped out the artificers who worked the Cannith facilities where they were created.</p>\n<h3>Warforged Lands</h3>\n<p>Warforged do not have any formal homeland, instead affiliating themselves with whatever nation purchased them upon creation. Cyre was the nation that relied on Warforged the most, leveraging its relative wealth to make up for its smaller population. With the destruction of Cyre many Warforged have found themselves lost and aimless, some flocking to New Cyre but others simply living in the wilds of the Five Nations.</p>\n<p>Some Warforged have decided that in the absence of any lands for them the Mournland should become theirs. The Lord of Blades declares the supremacy of steel and the weakness of flesh, and has organized a number of terrorist attacks from his hideout within the dead gray mists. The followers of the Becoming God believe that in the absence of any deity for the Warforged they must build their own.</p>\n<h3>Warforged Faiths</h3>\n<p>The uncertain nature of warforged souls has created a number of philosophies amongst the living constructs.</p>\n<p><strong>The Lord of Blades</strong>is a charismatic leader who lives in the Mournland, preaching that the Warforged represent a new and higher level of existence, destined to replace the weak races of flesh and blood. The Lord of Blades is rumored to own a creation forge, but most dismiss this as a self-serving rumor started by the Lord of Blades himself.</p>\n<p><strong>The Becoming God</strong>believe that warforged were granted souls be an otherwise unknown deity, and believe that it is their sacred duty to create a body for this deity in return for the gift of life.</p>\n<p><strong>The Reforged</strong>embrace the living half of their living construct nature, seeking to more thoroughly integrate themselves with the web of life around them that they replace metal with wood.</p>\n","asi":"","size":"Medium","speed":"30'","vision":"Normal","languages":"Common","skill":"+2 Endurance","competencies":"Knowledge of Creatures (Animate)","features":{"LivingConstruct":{"key":"LivingConstruct","label":"Living Construct","value":"You are a living construct.

They’re covered in scaly hide, but they don’t have tails. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6½ feet in height and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand. A dragonborn’s head features a blunt snout, a strong brow, and distinctive frills at the cheek and ear. Behind the brow, a crest of hornlike scales of various lengths resembles thick, ropy hair. Their eyes are shades of red or gold.</p>\n<p>A typical dragonborn’s scales can be scarlet, gold, rust, ocher, bronze, or brown. Rarely do an individ-ual’s scales match the hue of a chromatic or metallic dragon, and scale color gives no indication of the type of breath weapon a dragonborn uses. Most dragonborn have very fine scales over most of their body, giving their skin a leathery texture, with regions of larger scales on the forearms, lower legs and feet, shoulders, and thighs.</p>\n<p>Young dragonborn grow faster than human children do. They walk hours after hatching, reach the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3 and reach adulthood by 15. They live about as long as humans do.</p>\n<h3>Background and History</h3>\n<p>Dragonborn originate from Argonnessen. Tales maintain that great dragonborn city-states exist in Argonnessen's interior, warring with one another over territory over interpretations of the Draconic Prophecy, or at the behest of their dragon overlords.</p>\n<p>In Khorvaire, dragonborn are strongly associated with Q'barra. Long ago, dragonborn immigrants from Argonnessen formed an empire in the thick jungles of this region, conquering or annexing lizardfolk and kobold lands. They constructed huge monuments , tamed the wild, and stood on the verge of becoming one of Khorvaire's great powers. None today can say with certainty what happened to the empire. It fell as swiftly as it rose, leaving behind pockets of civilized dragonborn fighting for survival in a fierce jungle. Although the empire is long gone, dragonborn maintain a link to their storied past through their faith. They worship the Dragon Sovereigns, the draconic incarnations of the deities of the Sovereign Host. Evil dragonborn, on the other hand, typically worship the Dragon Below. Although dragonborn do not directly worship dragons, they respect them as emissaries of the gods, and they deeply revere the three progenitor wyrms : Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber. Dragonborn believe that the Draconic Prophecy is the way these ancients communicate with the dragons of today.</p>\n<h3>Dragonborn Lands</h3>\n<p>A few dragonborn travel the world as adventurers or merchants, but most of Khorvaire's dragonborn still live in [location:111462]. After centuries of eking out a living in the jungles, dragonborn communities in Q'barra have begun to thrive, forming new governments and trading with outsiders. By contrast, a few dragonborn tribes have instead turned savage, dwelling in the wild alongside lizardfolk and troglodytes. These dragonborn are a menace to settlements in Q'barra and to Q'barra's neighbors.</p>\n<p>A few dragonborn tribes dwell on Seren and other isles along the coast of [location:108295].

{"name":"Medusa","permission":{"default":0,"DXmL7wc74NRmbZdk":3},"type":"race","data":{"description":"\n<p>Eberron is a world of magic. Many forms of life have been shaped by magical forces. This can be seen in the minor illusion-weaving ability of the gnomes, the teleporting blink dog, or the petrifying gaze of the medusa. The deadly power of a medusa can certainly inspire terror, and thinking of this creature as a simple monster is easy. But medusas are not savage predators, roaming the wastes in search of prey. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal are, on average, more intelligent than most humans, and they have a proud city-state in the midst of Droaam. The power of the medusas is a potent weapon in the arsenal of Droaam. But what role do medusas play in the monster nation? How are they seen in the outside world? And what can you expect when dealing with them?</p>\n<h3><strong>T</strong>he Kingdom of Stone</h3>\n<p>The medusas were born in Khyber, and no one on the surface knows the extent of their subterranean civilization. In 778 YK, a force of medusas emerged from the underworld and laid claim to the city of Cazhaak Draal, an ancient goblin metropolis that had been abandoned since the daelkyr incursion. Over the course of the last two hundred years, the medusas renovated Cazhaak Draal, repairing the ruins and domesticating many of the dangerous creatures found in the region. For the most part the medusas were content in their tiny kingdom: Cazhaak Draal was far larger than their numbers required, and many treasures and wonders existed in the ancient city. Explorers who ventured into the Stonelands rarely returned, but the medusas had little interest in the outside world.</p>\n<p>This changed in 985 YK, when a mysterious visitor came to speak to the Queen of Stone: a gray-robed hag, who met the medusa's gaze without fear. Sora Teraza spoke with Queen Sheshka from sunrise to sunset, and after the hag departed, Sheshka spent the evening in silent contemplation. The next day she told her people to prepare for great change. Over the course of the next year she brought together a corps of medusas, preparing them for service in foreign lands. When the Daughters of Sora Kell assumed power in 986 YK, representatives of Cazhaak Draal were quickly dispatched to the Great Crag. Today medusa architects direct the ongoing construction of Droaam's capital. Medusas hold many positions of power, both in Droaam and in the monstrous communities that have since spread across Khorvaire; in Sharn, the medusa Kasslak maintains order in the dangerous district of Malleon's Gate, while a medusa named Harash is the second-in-command of Sharn's Daask cell. The deadly power of a medusa commands respect, but in a nation of ogres, minotaurs, and harpies, the keen intellect of the medusa is often more useful than its petrifying gaze.</p>\n<p>The people of Cazhaak Draal have prospered since the rise of the hags, and for the moment, the Queen of Stone is content to serve. The Daughters of Sora Kell are formidable enemies, and Sheshka does not have the power to challenge them. But the medusa queen is ambitious and cunning, and she is always searching for ways to increase her influence.</p>\n<h3>Children of Stone and Shadow</h3>\n<p>The Gatekeepers claim that medusas were created by the daelkyr Orlassk, but the medusa priests of Cazhaak Draal offer their devotions to the Shadow. They claim that the Shadow shaped many of the creatures humans see as monsters, giving the harpy her deadly voice, hiding the displacer beast from its foes, and healing the wounds of the troll. These priests view the deities of the Sovereign Host as the true evil, comparing the exile of the Shadow to the fear with which many humans respond to medusas and other monsters.</p>\n<p>Of course, some medusas do earn their evil reputation. Several revel in their powers and petrify lesser creatures for sport. But a medusa who calls this sort of attention to herself won't last long in one of the great cities of Khorvaire. Those medusas chosen to represent Droaam in the wider world are carefully vetted by Sheshka and officials of House Tharashk. The average medusa is more intelligent and cunning than the average human, and she understands the need to control her behavior among the soft people of Khorvaire. In Sharn, a medusa may move unfettered in the lawless districts, but if she enters a respectable neighborhood, she must wear eyeblinders, a metal visor secured with straps around forehead and chin; otherwise she may be attacked by the Blackened Book, Redcloak Battalion, or other agents of the law. Eyeblinders require a full minute to don or remove; in some cities, a medusa must have the blinders secured with a lock for the duration of her stay.</p>\n<p>Despite their worship of the Shadow, medusas are no more inherently evil than humans or elves. Some are arrogant and proud, believing that their deadly gaze places them above mundane creatures. Others respond to the fear they encounter every day by despising those who fear them, a path that often leads to evil alignments. But many enjoy the same pleasures that humans do, and seek out song, good company, and the satisfaction of hard work. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal have a strong tradition of stonework, both architecture and purely aesthetic sculpture. In recent years, Councilor Kilk of Sharn has sought permission to bring in medusa architects and masons to perform work in Northedge, although to date the other councilors have refused to use city funds to pay for the services of monsters.</p>\n<h3>Medusa Customs</h3>\n<p>The gaze of a medusa can petrify even an ally, and as a result, a medusa does not meet the gaze of a person with whom it is conversing. Where she directs her eyes indicates her esteem for the person. She drops her eyes toward the ground to show respect, or looks up and over the person if she wishes to indicate disdain; when speaking to an equal, she glances to the left or right. If she wishes to show trust, she directs her gaze to the person, but closes her eyes.</p>\n<p>While this may seem inconvenient to a human, it has little impact on a medusa. If a medusa concentrates, she can receive limited visual impressions from the serpents that make up her hair; as a result, though she seems to look elsewhere, she's actually looking through the eyes of her serpents. She can even use her serpents to see when she is blindfolded or has her eyes closed. However, she can still \"see\" in only one direction in this way; her serpents may look all around her, but she can't process the information from all of them at once. If a medusa is relying solely on the visual input from her serpents, she suffers a -2 penalty on Spot and Search checks.</p>\n<p>A medusa uses its living mane for many purposes. In addition to serving as weapons and a supplemental form of eyesight, a medusa's serpents also help her communicate. The motions of the serpents often reflect a medusa's mood, and a DM should consider the state of a medusa's mane when describing her actions. The medusas of Cazhaak Draal have developed a simple language called Serpentine, which is based on the motions and hissing of their snakes. Serpentine has no written aspect and can be spoken only by a medusa, but any creature can use Speak Language to learn to understand it. A medusa must learn Serpentine normally, but it is available to her as a bonus language.</p>\n<p>The gaze of a medusa is a powerful weapon, but most medusas don't think of it as deadly. A petrified victim can be restored to life, after all; within their own society, medusas often use petrification as a way to preserve mortally wounded kin, so they can be restored at a later time when healing magic is available. Likewise, medusas dying of old age often choose to be petrified before they fully pass on; Cazhaak Draal contains a great catacomb filled with the stone remnants of respected medusa elders. This ties to the love of stonework common in the culture; when a medusa looks at a statue, she sees the life it represents.</p>\n<p>While some medusas take an interest in archery, in general the medusas of Cazhaak Draal have little interest in physical combat; they prefer to win their battles with magic or cunning. Sorcerers, rogues, and experts are all common among the citizens of Cazhaak Draal; the city of stone is also home to smaller numbers of clerics, adepts, rangers, and fighters, with the latter specializing in ranged combat.</p>\n","asi":"","size":"","speed":"","vision":"","languages":"","skill":"","competencies":"","features":{}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","_id":"zLwajTFnYvvkQmAE"}
